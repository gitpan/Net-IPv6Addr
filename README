Net::IPv6Addr Version 0.1
=========================

formats described by RFC1884.  If Math::Base85 is installed, formats
described in RFC1924 are also valid.  It will generate "IP6.INT."
strings (as described in RFC1886) if you are inclined to play with
DNS records.

This module needs Net::IPv4Addr to function properly.

The usual installation instructions apply:
